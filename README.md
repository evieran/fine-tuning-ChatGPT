# Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to simplify the process of fine-tuning GPT-3.5 for specific tasks. Whether you're looking to build a model for creative writing or to solve complex puzzles, this notebook has got you covered.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Access to OpenAI's GPT-3 API
- Install additional Python packages (`openai`, `tenacity`)

## How to Use

1. **Describe Your Model**: Go to the first code cell and describe the task you want the model to perform. Be as descriptive as possible.
    - For example: "A model that answers trivia questions."
  
2. **Set Hyperparameters**: Adjust the `temperature` and `number_of_examples` variables to suit your needs.
    - `temperature` affects the creativity of the model (higher value = more creative, lower value = more precise).
    - `number_of_examples` sets the number of training examples to generate.

3. **Run All Cells**: Execute all cells in the notebook to train and generate examples.

## Files

## Sections

1. **Describe your model**: Introduction and guidelines on how to specify your model.
2. **Data Generation**: Code to generate training examples based on your description.
3. **Installation Steps**: Code to install required Python packages.
4. ... (and so on)

## Code Snippets

- Generate Training Examples
  ```python
  prompt = "Your model description here"
  temperature = .4
  number_of_examples = 50

##  API Configuration

openai.api_key = "YOUR KEY HERE"
